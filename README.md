# storage-scout

This is (yet another) JSON-centric file-system-based storage API, using [sander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sander) to store data in a folder in `.json` files, one file per data point.

### API

There are five methods exposed:

#### storageScout.create
#### storageScout.readAll
#### storageScout.readOne
#### storageScout.update
#### storageScout.delete

These are standard CRUD operations on data.
